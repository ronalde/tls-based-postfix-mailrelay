# moved to https://gitlab.com/ronalde/tls-based-postfix-mailrelay due to Microsoft deal

Although Microsoft and partners push the message that Microsoft is Developer and open source friendly due to its new CEO and strategy, I don't believe it. And neither should you. New CEO or not, it is of course the investors that dictate strategy. And open source simply isn't a viable option when you're in the money-making business.

That means that sooner rather than later this at best will turn out to be an embrace, extend, and extinguish deal.
